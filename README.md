## 🧠 How Scoring Works

The extension calculates a **score out of 100** based on key client data:

| Metric                  | Description                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hiring Rate**          | % of posted jobs that resulted in a hire                   |
| **Payment Verified**     | Whether the client’s payment method is verified            |
| **Recent Activity**      | How recently the client was active or viewed the job       |
| **Job History**          | Number of jobs posted previously                           |
| **Total Spending**       | Total amount spent by the client on Upwork                 |

You can **adjust the weight** given to each of these factors in the extension settings.
